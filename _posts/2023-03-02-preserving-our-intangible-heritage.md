# Preserving our intangible heritage is crucial in who we are as Filipinos

In our cadetship course this week, we were tasked to write a speech on the topic "Preservation of the Intangible Heritage of the Philippines." I would like to share the short output I prepared.

Ladies and gentlemen, Mabuhay!

Allow me to express my sincerest gratitude for the opportunity to speak on this momentous occasion. 

Last night, we had a very “Filipino” dinner–rice, chicken _adobo_, and salted egg with tomatoes. Such dinner, for us, is simple. But I recall stories of those who were assigned abroad and the necessity of a rice cooker. And when I studied abroad, cooking adobo could be expensive because you can’t use just any soy sauce–and you would have to get this from a Filipino or Asian store. 

The more I pondered upon this simple dinner, the more it made me contemplate a more important story–that of our nation. 

While I am sure we can all agree that _adobo_ is a humble dish, what we imagine as _adobo_ could be very different. I grew up in Cavite but my image of _adobo_ is close to humba, as prepared by Boholanon mother. And yet Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo is said to have enjoyed _adobo sa dilaw_. There too is the _adobo sa puti_ which is cooked with vinegar and _adobo_ in the Bicol region which is cooked with fish sauce or _patis_. 

As such, the adobo is more than just a dish. It encapsulates our different practices and beliefs. It is a reminder of our ongoing project in understanding and defining what it means to be a Filipino. It is our cultural heritage. 

Heritage, as “pamana,” is described by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as either tangible or intangible. Intangible heritage includes oral traditions, performing arts, social practices, and knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe. 

Benedict Anderson, a renowned sociologist, once said, “Communities are to be distinguished not by their falsity or genuineness, but by the style in which they are imagined.” In his seminal work, “Imagined Communities,” Anderson views that nations are created through a combination of historical processes and cultural practices and not mere expressions of pre-existing ethnolinguistic groups.

As such, defining what it means to be a Filipino is a process, and at its core is our intangible heritage. 

While the adobo is a ubiquitous image of our heritage, much of our other intangible heritage may be lost to time. On the one hand, the Philippines was able to inscribe the Hudhud Chants of Ifugao and the Darangan epic of the Maranao people in the UNESCO register. But the UN body also recognized that Buklog, the thanksgiving ritual of the Subanen, requires urgent safeguarding. 

The government has made some strides in this arena through our continued effort to document the beliefs, rituals, and other intangibles of our ethnolinguistic groups. We also intensified the institutionalization of the School of Living Traditions. The preservation of our mother tongues was also made possible through the support of the Department of Education.

But to tackle the challenge at scale, we need to mobilize resources. Our travel taxes funded the restoration of the churches in Bohol that were flattened by the earthquake that struck the island in 2013. But as domestic and international challenges require a greater focus on infrastructure, education, and social welfare, funds for the preservation of our heritage have remained a minuscule slice of the pie.

Perhaps the challenge is not just what the government can do. Perhaps, in each of us lies the brick that builds the foundation of what it means to be a Filipino.

In addition to the great texts we read, perhaps it is about time that our students also read the Silungan Baltapa of the Sama Dilaut. In addition to the creative stories we watch every holiday season, our entertainment business would enjoy translating the epic battles of Labbaw Donggon to film. In addition to the creation of Josie Rizal as a character in a fighting game, we can also popularize a character based on Lam-ang.

Instead of unraveling how each story was made unique by the ethnolinguistic group that gave birth to such heritage, we have much to learn from their shared themes of tenacity and valor. Instead of looking at how our _adobos_ differ, we could instead look at it as a shared platter, a shared way of looking at food.

By sharing, promoting, and embracing our food, stories, and every other intangible heritage, here and abroad, we take a step closer to their salinlahi, their preservation. 

The late Neils Mulder, a luminary anthropologist on the nationhood of the Philippines, once wrote, “nation building remains a task stretching way into the future.” By preserving and promoting our intangible heritage, we learn better the meaning of being a Filipino and bring the task of nation-building closer to the present day.

Thank you.
