## Success is spelled with two c’s (Part 1): Or why you should master the doctrine of completed staff work (CSW)!

With the chapter of my life called the *twenties* coming to a close, I’ve been reflecting on my life and growth in the past decade. Amidst all  the *what-if’s* and *should-have’s*, I also learned that every quality audit also involves some recognition of good practices. Time and again, the two most important work principles that I learned to be crucial to success are simply (i) Completed Staff Work (CSW) and (ii) Cover Your A** (CYA). 

For the first issue in this new series that I’m experimenting on, I hope to focus first on the doctrine of CSW. I hope that by writing about this principle—which is also a practice in and of itself—this writing space takes one step closer to its goal of helping you get over the hump day.

### The Doctrine of Completed Staff Work
My very first job was in the public communications unit of a government agency’s “Office of the Secretary” or OSEC. I didn’t experience the same level of stress and workload as the key staffers of the core OSEC. However, I had the opportunity to witness and understand the realities necessary to make things work or bring to fruition “change” through public service. There, my superiors and principals taught and reminded us of the doctrine of Completed Staff Work (CSW).

A copy of the original text first published in 29 January 1942 for the US Army is available through [this link](https://govleaders.org/completed-staff-work.htm). The original text could be summarized through its penultimate bullet point: “If you were the Chief would you be willing to sign the paper you have prepared, and stake your professional reputation on it being right?”

With a closer read at what fundamentally is the litmus test of any office work, are two (2) key parts. First, preparing the “paper” such that your principal will be willing to sign. Second, to prepare it in a way where you can stake your professional reputation on its veracity, and—if I may add—its effectiveness to your bottomline. Let me start with the latter

### Getting your the “yes” of your boss
I had the opportunity to work for different bosses throughout my twenties. Some were hands-off but sprinkle feedback from time to time. Some were more demanding—with “take-ups” at the beginning and end of the work day. 

The latter type of bosses kept me on my toes. They would check if my draft document addressed the issue at hand or met its goals—and if my command of English is adequate. But they would also ask issues related to what I wrote. *Why do you think this agency decided on the matter this way?* or *How much does this project cost again?*

These questions test my grasp of the issue, e.g. if I have anticipated the next steps of the document’s receiving end. For new policies, this meant sufficient mastery of subject matter and its related literature—no matter the (short) lead time to the preparation of the document. For wicked problems, this translates to the understanding of why the problem is wicked and the anticipation of options for your superior.

I’ve learned that these bosses kept on my toes precisely because I was not sufficiently prepared. CSW means anticipating the questions that my boss will ask or face and preparing for these answers. Thus, I’ve learned that one best practice for CSW is the preparation of a briefer.

### Briefers are fundamental in your CSW
Did you know that tech giant Amazon (supposedly) start their meetings by reading a [6-page “narrative”](https://money.com/amazon-meetings-no-powerpoint/) and conduct said meeting without a keynote? This document is fundamentally a “briefer”—a distillation of the issue, its salient/contentious points, and closing with an assessment of the options. 

For small/minor matters, a mental construct of such a briefer is crucial. For more complex issues, preparing an actual briefer for your superior is paramount. First, it allows you to paraphrase the issue in your words and help you master it—thereby equipping you with the knowledge to answer your superior’s myriad questions. Second, it shows to your boss that you did your homework. And most importantly, it is a contribution to the organizational knowledge. 

In the preparation of our briefer, the other principles of CSW should be observed. This includes consultations with other more knowledgeable staffers to get the most accurate appreciation of the facts. 

This document is also an opportunity to add value. Not only could we assess the issue on being “right,” but we could also assess the effectiveness of our options vis-a-vis the organization’s bottomlines.

By doing our homework, our recommendations and prepared documents will give confidence to our superiors. In the end, this will make it easier for them to stake their professional reputation on the decision being “right.” 

We can now, in turn, prepare the “take-up experience” so that your superior will sign or approve the document/policy you prepared. 

### Assembling the “take-up experience”
Our superiors experience the day quite differently than we do. In the pre-COVID era, this meant various courtesy calls, phone conversations, never-ending meetings, transits to/from these meetings, and everything in between and simulatenously at that. 

As such, we have a limited time to bring them up to speed with the issues at hand. This requires that we prepare a complete packet upon “take-up” time.

First, the expected document should have been drafted, e.g. a letter or a memorandum as the case requires. Run it through a grammar-checking program. Ensure the alignment of the print-out.

The memorandum should also contain all of the referenced material. This includes the faxes and other memoranda mentioned in your primary document. This will minimize the back-and-forth and evidence-gathering that your superior will have to do. If they want to verify the action of another office, they can easily do so because it is already in your packet. 

All relevant drafts should be likewise included. If your memorandum contains a recommendation to send a letter to another office, a draft of such letter should be included in your packet. Once again, this will make your take-up time efficient. If you did your homework and your superior agreed with your recommendation, your superior could already check and sign on the document that will put that recommendation into action. Of course, they may agree with your recommendation but have comments on the attachments; but this is still more efficient because you are going back to your desk with clearer ways to move forward. 

So while the original text of the Doctrine of Completed Staff Work talked about the signing of a paper, observance of the CSW fundamentally entails the preparation of this packet. For good measure, read your print-out, correct errors and re-print, if necessary. I had draft letters that did not meet their intended sending date because my superior had to correct grammatical errors. When time is of the essence, minimizing and removing such delays is crucial. 

### “Perfect is the enemy of the good”
While I mentioned the importance of grammar checks, ensuring good print-outs, and preparation of a briefer and a packet, this should not cause any paralysis in our work. As [they say](https://hbr.org/tip/2020/02/dont-let-perfect-be-the-enemy-of-good), “perfect is the enemy of the good.”

We have to balance the time we spend on one issue and prepare sufficiently for it. Mastery does not require a doctoral level of understanding on the issue; only that we have read *enough*. As you grow in your field, this level of *enough* will hopefully become more apparent. 

For briefers and presentation, use templates and start with the core ideas. Work on the bells and whistles if time permits. Remember, these issues also need to be taken up with your superior at the soonest; and no masterpiece of a slide deck can make up for “missing the boat.”

### Mastering CSW is vital to success
In this short piece, we’ve talked about the importance of CSW and how to actualize the principles from the 1942 army memorandum. In my experience, this allowed me to get things done and secure the confidence of my superiors regarding my outputs. In turn, this opened new opportunities.

At the end of the day, CSW allows us to communicate to our superiors that “we got their back.” In the next issue, we’ll talk about protecting ours.
